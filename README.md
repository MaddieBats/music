# Filename Structure for Recordings

All files need to have:
* Date of recording (yymmdd)
* Author of recording (usually MD)

Optional metadata:
* Date of recording (hhmmss)
* Location of recording (LOClocation)
* Reminder of what it is (REMreminder)

Optional Flags:
* Tic/Stim : TIC
* Music : MUS
* Bat : BAT

E.g. the recording `recordings/anthropogenic/music/electronic/250110_MD_230523_LOCfold_REMdjtool_MUS_SEX.wav` would be a recording of dj tool played on the decks at Fold to Maddie starting at 23:05 on 10/01/25 and also Maddie is having sex on the recording.
